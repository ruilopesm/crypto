## üìù Cryptography

This repository contains a collection of cryptography-related projects and resources implemented by me from scratch. The projects cover various cryptographic ciphers, schemes, protocols and algebraic structures.

## üìÇ Projects

- [Tweakable Block Cipher](tweakable-block-cipher/)
- [Sponge Construction](sponge-construction/)
- [Station to Station](sts/)
- [ElGamal](elgamal/) and [ElGamal over Elliptic Curves](elgamal/elliptic-curves/)
- [EdDSA](eddsa/)

I'm currently working on a few more projects and learning about the following topics:

- Oblivious Transfer
- Garbled Circuits
- Zero-Knowledge Protocols
- Security Games for IND-CPA, IND-CCA, INT-PTXT and INT-CTXT
